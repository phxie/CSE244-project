- abstract: Deep learning training (DLT), e.g., large language model (LLM) training,
    has become one of the most important services in multitenant cloud computing.
    By deeply studying in-production DLT jobs, we observed that communication contention
    among different DLT jobs seriously influences the overall GPU computation utilization,
    resulting in the low efficiency of the training cluster. In this paper, we present
    Crux, a communication scheduler that aims to maximize GPU computation utilization
    by mitigating the communication contention among DLT jobs. Maximizing GPU computation
    utilization for DLT, nevertheless, is NP-Complete; thus, we formulate and prove
    a novel theorem to approach this goal by GPU intensity-aware communication scheduling.
    Then, we propose an approach that prioritizes the DLT flows with high GPU computation
    intensity, reducing potential communication contention. Our 96-GPU testbed experiments
    show that Crux improves 8.3% to 14.8% GPU computation utilization. The large-scale
    production trace-based simulation further shows that Crux increases GPU computation
    utilization by up to 23% compared with alternatives including Sincronia, TACCL,
    and CASSINI.

  url: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3651890.3672239
- abstract: "Cloud operators utilize collective communication optimizers to enhance\
    \ the efficiency of the single-tenant, centrally managed training clusters they\
    \ manage. However, current optimizers struggle to scale for such use cases and\
    \ often compromise solution quality for scalability. Our solution, TE-CCL, adopts\
    \ a traffic-engineering-based approach to collective communication. Compared to\
    \ a state-of-the-art optimizer, TACCL, TE-CCL produced schedules with 2\xD7 better\
    \ performance on topologies TACCL supports (and its solver took a similar amount\
    \ of time as TACCL's heuristic-based approach). TECCL additionally scales to larger\
    \ topologies than TACCL. On our GPU testbed, TE-CCL outperformed TACCL by 2.14\xD7\
    \ and RCCL by 3.18\xD7 in terms of algorithm bandwidth."

  title: Rethinking Machine Learning Collective Communication as a Multi-Commodity
    Flow Problem
  url: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3651890.3672249
- abstract: As large language models (LLMs) take on complex tasks, their inputs are
    supplemented with longer contexts that incorporate domain knowledge. Yet using
    long contexts is challenging as nothing can be generated until the whole context
    is processed by the LLM. While the context-processing delay can be reduced by
    reusing the KV cache of a context across different inputs, fetching the KV cache,
    which contains large tensors, over the network can cause high extra network delays.

- abstract: 'Recently, researchers have proposed ML-driven traffic engineering (TE)
    schemes where a neural network model is used to produce TE decisions in lieu of
    conventional optimization solvers. Unfortunately existing ML-based TE schemes
    are not explicitly designed to be robust to topology changes that may occur due
    to WAN evolution, failures or planned maintenance. In this paper, we present HARP,
    a neural model for TE explicitly capable of handling variations in topology including
    those not observed in training. HARP is designed with two principles in mind:
    (i) ensure invariances to natural input transformations (e.g., permutations of
    node ids, tunnel reordering); and (ii) align neural architecture to the optimization
    model. Evaluations on a multi-week dataset of a large private WAN show HARP achieves
    an MLU at most 11% higher than optimal over 98% of the time despite encountering
    significantly different topologies in testing relative to training data. Further,
    comparisons with state-of-the-art ML-based TE schemes indicate the importance
    of the mechanisms introduced by HARP to handle topology variability. Finally,
    when predicted traffic matrices are provided, HARP outperforms classic optimization
    solvers achieving a median reduction in MLU of 5 to 10% on the true traffic matrix.'

  title: Transferable Neural WAN TE for Changing Topologies
  url: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3651890.3672237
- abstract: "In today's virtualized cloud, containers and virtual machines (VMs) are\
    \ prevailing methods to deploy applications with different tenant requirements.\
    \ However, these requirements are at odds with the resource allocation capabilities\
    \ of conventional networking stacks in wide-area networks (WANs). In particular,\
    \ existing WAN traffic engineering (TE) systems at the granularity of aggregated\
    \ traffic flows are not designed to cater to each individual flow. In this paper,\
    \ we advocate for a radical new approach to extend TE systems to involve millions\
    \ of virtual instance endpoints. We propose and implement a first-of-its-kind\
    \ system, called MegaTE, to satisfy the needs of each fine-grained traffic flow\
    \ at the virtual instance level. At the core of the MegaTE system is the paradigm\
    \ shift from the top-down centralized control to the bottom-up asynchronous query\
    \ in the TE control loop, combined with eBPF-based segment routing on the data\
    \ plane and TE optimization contraction on the control plane. We evaluate MegaTE\
    \ using flow-level simulations with production traffic traces. Our results show\
    \ that MegaTE supports 20\xD7 more endpoints with the similar algorithm run time\
    \ compared to prior work. MegaTE has been adopted by large-scale public cloud\
    \ providers. Notably, Tencent rolled out MegaTE in its cloud WAN since December\
    \ 2022. Our production analysis shows that MegaTE reduces the packet latency of\
    \ real-time applications by up to 51%."

  title: 'MegaTE: Extending WAN Traffic Engineering to Millions of Endpoints in Virtualized
    Cloud'
  url: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3651890.3672242
- abstract: "Traffic Engineering (TE) is critical for improving network performance\
    \ and reliability. A key challenge in TE is the management of sudden traffic bursts.\
    \ Existing TE schemes either do not handle traffic bursts or uniformly guard against\
    \ traffic bursts, thereby facing difficulties in achieving a balance between normal-case\
    \ performance and burst-case performance. To address this issue, we introduce\
    \ FIGRET, a Fine-Grained Robustness-Enhanced TE scheme. FIGRET offers a novel\
    \ approach to TE by providing varying levels of robustness enhancements, customized\
    \ according to the distinct traffic characteristics of various source-destination\
    \ pairs. By leveraging a burst-aware loss function and deep learning techniques,\
    \ FIGRET is capable of generating high-quality TE solutions efficiently. Our evaluations\
    \ of real-world production networks, including Wide Area Networks and data centers,\
    \ demonstrate that FIGRET significantly outperforms existing TE schemes. Compared\
    \ to the TE scheme currently deployed in Google's Jupiter data center networks,\
    \ FIGRET achieves a 9%-34% reduction in average Maximum Link Utilization and improves\
    \ solution speed by 35\xD7-1800\xD7. Against DOTE, a state-of-the-art deep learning-based\
    \ TE method, FIGRET substantially lowers the occurrence of significant congestion\
    \ events triggered by traffic bursts by 41%-53.9% in topologies with high traffic\
    \ dynamics."

- abstract: The Internet congestion control landscape is rapidly evolving. Since the
    introduction of BBR and the deployment of QUIC, it has become increasingly commonplace
    for companies to modify and implement their own congestion control algorithms
    (CCAs). To respond effectively to these developments, it is crucial to understand
    the state of CCA deployments in the wild. Unfortunately, existing CCA identification
    tools are not future-proof and do not work well with modern CCAs and encrypted
    protocols like QUIC. In this paper, we articulate the challenges in designing
    a future-proof CCA identification tool and propose a measurement methodology that
    directly addresses these challenges. The resulting measurement tool, called Nebby,
    can identify all the CCAs currently available in the Linux kernel and BBRv2 with
    an average accuracy of 96.7%. We found that among the Alexa Top 20k websites,
    the share of BBR has shrunk since 2019 and that only 8% of them responded to QUIC
    requests. Among these QUIC servers, CUBIC and BBR seem equally popular. We show
    that Nebby is extensible by extending it for Copa and an undocumented family of
    CCAs that is deployed by 6% of the measured websites, including major corporations
    like Hulu and Apple.

  title: Keeping an Eye on Congestion Control in the Wild with Nebby
  url: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3651890.3672223
- abstract: 'The traditional slow-start mechanism in TCP can result in slow ramping-up
    of the data delivery rate, inefficient bandwidth utilization, and prolonged completion
    time for small-size flows, especially in networks with a large bandwidth-delay
    product (BDP). Existing solutions either only work in specific situations, or
    require network assistance, making them challenging (if even possible) to deploy.
    This paper presents SUSS (Speeding Up Slow Start): a lightweight, sender-side
    add-on to the traditional slow-start mechanism, that aims to safely expedite the
    growth of the congestion window when a flow is significantly below its optimal
    fair share of the available bandwidth. SUSS achieves this by accelerating the
    growth in cwnd when exponential growth is predicted to continue in the next round.
    SUSS employs a novel combination of ACK clocking and packet pacing to effectively
    mitigate traffic burstiness caused by accelerated increases in cwnd. We have implemented
    SUSS in the Linux kernel, integrated into the CUBIC congestion control algorithm.
    Our real-world experiments span many device types and Internet locations, demonstrating
    that SUSS consistently outperforms traditional slow-start with no measured negative
    impacts. SUSS achieves over 20% improvement in flow completion time in all experiments
    with flow sizes less than 5MB and RTT larger than 50 ms.'

- abstract: Existing network verifiers can efficiently identify failure-induced bugs.
    However, an equally-important concern is identification of external-routes-induced
    bugs, which has not been well addressed. Comprehensively reasoning about external
    routes is challenging, since each external neighbor can advertise an arbitrary
    set of routes, which is quite a huge space. This paper introduces a new network
    verifier, Expresso, which uses symbolic simulation to explore the equivalences
    in the space of external routes. We evaluate the effectiveness and scalability
    of Expresso on the WAN of a large cloud service provider and Internet2. Expresso
    found various property violations, some of which have already been confirmed by
    the operators. To the best of our knowledge, Expresso is the only verifier that
    can check the correctness of WANs amidst arbitrary external routes in a tractable
    amount of time, while other verifiers time-out after 1 day.

- abstract: Relational network verification is a new approach for validating network
    changes. In contrast to traditional network verification, which analyzes specifications
    for a single network snapshot, it analyzes specifications that capture similarities
    and differences between two network snapshots (e.g., pre- and post-change snapshots).
    Relational specifications are compact and precise because they focus on the flows
    and paths that change between snapshots and then simply mandate that all other
    network behaviors "stay the same", without enumerating them. To achieve similar
    guarantees, single-snapshot specifications would need to enumerate all flow and
    path behaviors that are not expected to change in order to enable checking that
    nothing has accidentally changed. Such specifications are proportional to network
    size, which makes them impractical to generate for many real-world networks.

- abstract: Ensuring service availability in large-scale datacenters hinges on network
    monitoring. For monitoring quality, it is essential to attain sufficient coverage
    of all physical components. However, given the ever-evolving complexity of industrial
    environments, even measuring coverage metrics becomes challenging, let alone attaining
    sufficient coverage. In fact, insufficient coverage widely existed in our production
    datacenters and caused many missed failures.

  title: 'RD-Probe: Scalable Monitoring With Sufficient Coverage In Complex Datacenter
    Networks'

- abstract: "Sketches are useful for network measurement thanks to their low resource\
    \ overheads and theoretically bounded accuracy. However, their network-wide deployment\
    \ suffers from the trade-off between optimality and scalability: (1) Most solutions\
    \ rely on mixed integer linear programming (MILP) solvers to provide the optimal\
    \ decisions. But they are time-consuming and can hardly scale to large-scale deployment\
    \ scenarios. (2) While heuristics achieve scalability, they deteriorate resource\
    \ and performance overheads. We propose Eagle, a framework that achieves scalable\
    \ and near-optimal network-wide sketch deployment. Our key idea is to decompose\
    \ network-wide sketch deployment into sub-problems. Such decomposition allows\
    \ Eagle to (1) simultaneously optimize switch resource consumption and end-to-end\
    \ performance (retaining optimality), and (2) incorporate time-saving techniques\
    \ into sub-problem solving (achieving scalability). Compared to existing solutions,\
    \ Eagle improves scalability by up to 255\xD7 with negligible loss of optimality.\
    \ It has also saved administrators in a production network days of efforts and\
    \ reduced the operation time from O(hour) to O(second)."

- abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) represents an innovative paradigm
    for enhancing spectrum and hardware utilization for both sensing and communication.
    A specific type of ISAC, radar backscatter communication, involves low-power nodes
    embedding data onto radar signal reflections rather than generating new signals.
    However, existing radar backscatter techniques only facilitate uplink communication
    from the tag to the radar, neglecting downlink communication. This paper introduces
    BiScatter, an integrated radar backscatter communication and sensing system that
    enables simultaneous uplink and downlink backscatter communication, radar sensing,
    and backscatter localization. This is achieved through the design of chirp-slope-shift-keying
    modulation on top of Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radars, complemented
    by passive differential circuitry at the backscatter tags for low-power decoding.
    BiScatter also presents a packet structure compatible with off-the-shelf radars
    that offer accurate data processing and synchronization between radar and tag.
    We prototype this backscatter network in both 9GHz and 24GHz, demonstrating its
    capability to extend across different frequency bands. Our evaluations demonstrate
    that BiScatter supports two-way backscatter communication with BER lower than
    10-3 up to 7m range and centimeter-level tag localization accuracy on top of off-the-shelf
    FMCW radars. The presented approach significantly augments the versatility and
    efficiency of ISAC for low-power devices.

- abstract: By aggregating multiple channels, Carrier Aggregation (CA) is an important
    technology for boosting cellular network bandwidth. Given diverse radio bands
    made available in 5G networks, CA plays a particularly critical role in achieving
    the goal of multi-Gbps throughput performance. In this paper, we carry out a timely
    comprehensive measurement study of CA deployment in commercial 5G networks (as
    well as 4G networks). We identify the key factors that influence whether CA is
    deployed and when, as well as which band combinations are used. Thus, we reveal
    the challenges posed by CA in 5G performance analysis and prediction as well as
    their implications in application quality-of-experience (QoE). We argue for and
    develop a novel CA-aware deep learning framework, dubbed Prism5G, which explicitly
    accounts for the complexity introduced by CA to more effectively predict 5G network
    throughput performance. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate the superiority
    of Prism5G over existing throughput prediction algorithms. Prism5G improves 5G
    throughput prediction accuracy by over 14% on average and a maximum of 22%. Using
    two use cases as examples, we further illustrate how Prism5G can aid applications
    in optimizing QoE performance.

  title: 'Dissecting Carrier Aggregation in 5G Networks: Measurement, QoE Implications
    and Prediction'

- abstract: We describe our experience building and deploying a demand-oblivious optically-switched
    network based on the RotorNet and Opera architectures. We detail the design, manufacture,
    deployment, and end-to-end operation of a 128-port optical rotor switch along
    with supporting NIC hardware and host software. Using this prototype, we assess
    yield, synchronization, and interoperability with commodity hardware and software
    at a scale of practical relevance. We provide the first real-world measurements
    of Linux TCP throughput and host-to-host latency in an operational RotorNet, achieving
    98% of link rate with 99th-percentile ping times faster than commodity packet-switching
    hardware. In the process, we uncover unexpected challenges with link-level dropouts
    and devise a novel and flexible way to address them. Our deployment experience
    demonstrates the feasibility of our implementation approach and identifies opportunities
    for future exploration.

- abstract: Recent advances in fast optical switching technology show promise in meeting
    the high goodput and low latency requirements of datacenter networks (DCN). We
    present NegotiaToR, a simple network architecture for optical reconfigurable DCNs
    that utilizes on-demand scheduling to handle dynamic traffic. In NegotiaToR, racks
    exchange scheduling messages through an in-band control plane and distributedly
    calculate non-conflicting paths from binary traffic demand information. Optimized
    for incasts, it also provides opportunities to bypass scheduling delays. NegotiaToR
    is compatible with prevalent flat topologies, and is tailored towards a minimalist
    design for on-demand reconfigurable DCNs, enhancing practicality. Through large-scale
    simulations, we show that NegotiaToR achieves both small mice flow completion
    time (FCT) and high goodput on two representative flat topologies, especially
    under heavy loads. Particularly, the FCT of mice flows is one to two orders of
    magnitude better than the state-of-the-art traffic-oblivious reconfigurable DCN
    design.

- abstract: Real-world network configurations play a critical role in network management
    and research tasks. While valuable, data holders often hesitate to share them
    due to business and privacy concerns. Existing methods are deficient in concealing
    the implicit information that can be inferred from configurations, such as topology
    and routing paths. To address this, we present ConfMask, a novel framework designed
    to systematically anonymize network topology and routing paths in configurations.
    Our approach tackles key privacy, utility, and scalability challenges, which arise
    from the strong dependency between different datasets and complex routing protocols.
    Our anonymization algorithm is scalable to large networks and effectively mitigates
    de-anonymization risk. Moreover, it maintains essential network properties such
    as reachability, waypointing and multi-path consistency, making it suitable for
    a wide range of downstream tasks. Compared to existing dataplane anonymization
    algorithm (i.e., NetHide), ConfMask reduces ~75% specification differences between
    the original and the anonymized networks.

- abstract: Residential fixed broadband internet access in the US remains inequitable,
    despite significant taxpayer investment. This paper evaluates the efficacy of
    the Connect America Fund (CAF), which subsidizes new broadband monopolies in underserved
    areas to provide internet access comparable to that in urban regions. CAF's oversight
    relies heavily on self-reported data from internet service providers (ISPs). Unfortunately,
    the reliability of this self-reported data has always been open to question. We
    use the broadband-plan querying tool (BQT) to create a novel dataset that complements
    ISP-reported information with ISP-advertised broadband plan details from publicly
    accessible websites for 537k residential addresses across 15 states. Our analysis
    reveals significant discrepancies, with a serviceability rate of only 55.45%,
    indicating that a significant fraction of addresses certified as served are still
    unserved. Furthermore, we observe a compliance rate of only 33.03%, indicating
    that a significant fraction of served addresses receive download speeds that are
    non-compliant with the FCC's 10 Mbps threshold for CAF-served addresses. Although
    we observe that CAF-served addresses occasionally receive higher download speeds
    than their monopoly-served neighbors, overall, the CAF program has largely failed
    to achieve its intended goal, leaving many targeted rural communities with inadequate
    or no broadband connectivity.

    Inequities

- abstract: Fine-grained monitoring is crucial for multiple data-driven tasks such
    as debugging, provisioning, and securing networks. Yet, practical constraints
    in collecting, extracting, and storing data often force operators to use coarse-grained
    sampled monitoring, degrading the performance of the various tasks. In this work,
    we explore the feasibility of leveraging the correlations among coarse-grained
    time series to impute their fine-grained counterparts in software. We present
    Zoom2Net, a transformer-based model for network imputation that incorporates domain
    knowledge through operational and measurement constraints, ensuring that the imputed
    network telemetry time series are not only realistic but align with existing measurements.
    This approach enhances the capabilities of current monitoring infrastructures,
    allowing operators to gain more insights into system behaviors without the need
    for hardware upgrades. We evaluate Zoom2Net on four diverse datasets (e.g., cloud
    telemetry and Internet data transfer) and use cases (e.g., bursts analysis and
    traffic classification). We demonstrate that Zoom2Net consistently achieves high
    imputation accuracy with a zoom-in factor of up to 100 and performs better on
    downstream tasks compared to baselines by an average of 38%.

- abstract: Detecting where traffic enters a network enhances network operation, but
    poses a complex measurement problem that requires analyzing a continuous traffic
    stream from all border routers---a challenging task for ISPs in the absence of
    a scalable approach.
